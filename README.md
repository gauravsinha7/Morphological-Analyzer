# Morphological-Analyzer
**This project deals with study of internal structure of words**

Previously, *Morphology learning* was based on a **semi-supervised** setting, where a small set of linguistic gold standard analyses is available.
Morfessor Baseline, is a method for unsupervised morphological segmentation. Morfessor Baseline shows linguistic segmentations can be exploited by
adding them into the data likelihood function and optimizing separate weights for unlabeled and labeled data.

***The work deals with Morphological Analysis in an unsupervised setting using state-of-the-art LSTMs***
